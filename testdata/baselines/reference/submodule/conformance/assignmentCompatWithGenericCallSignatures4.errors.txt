assignmentCompatWithGenericCallSignatures4.ts(12,1): error TS2719: Type '<T>(z: T) => void' is not assignable to type '<T>(z: T) => void'. Two different types with this name exist, but they are unrelated.
  Types of parameters 'z' and 'z' are incompatible.
    Type 'T' is not assignable to type 'I2<T>'.
      Type 'I2<I2<T>>' is not assignable to type 'I2<T>'.
        Type 'I2<T>' is not assignable to type 'T'.
          'T' could be instantiated with an arbitrary type which could be unrelated to 'I2<T>'.
